# The AGA Way

## Content model and rules specific to each part of the DCM

## Domain  – content model

[to be added, but these don’t change much]

### Description

## Capability – content model and rules

Across all sections of a capability page content must:

- follow the Style Manual on [Paragraphs \| Style Manual](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/paragraphs).
- use [plain language and word choice \| Style Manual](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/clear-language-and-writing-style/plain-language-and-word-choice) to clearly convey complex concepts
- have headings which match the section name.

Any section within a capability page may:

- use lists
- use links within text to other AGA content or external resources.

### Definition section

This section must

- define the digital capability
- explain the relevance of the capability to the context of government.

This section should

- aim to be no more than 200 words.

This section may need to

- briefly define any significant component part of the capability
- explain the distinguishing elements of a capability from others in the AGA where there is apparent similarity.

### Purpose section

This section must

- describe the purpose of the capability
- include a description of how the capability is realised.

This section should

- be [how long?]
- have a sentence or two at the start of the section
- use bullet points under the ‘how it is realised’ bit
- explain why it is important or essential, including how it contributes to or impacts an entity’s goals, operations, security, efficiency and compliance

Example:

[Add in example]

### Objectives section

The objective section relates to the objective of AGA content related to the capability (not the objective of having a capability).

This section must

- specify clear, measurable objectives of the capability
- be written as a list
- use sentence case to refer to the capability in its general sense (common nouns, not proper nouns).

This section should

- not be a repetition of the purpose
- include objectives which are both short term and long term objectives
- be specific to the capability, not repetition of the purpose of the AGA overall.

Example

Objectives

The objectives of this Australian Government Architecture (AGA) content are to:

- Ensure application solutions across Government are implemented to an appropriately secure standard relevant to their risk of security compromise.
- Ensure that application solutions across government meet the contractual and policy obligations for security in applications.

### Whole of Government Applicability section

This section should:

- include linked reference to the instruments which impose relevant obligations on Commonwealth entities (including the most relevant legislation and whole of government strategies)
- use brief bullet points to capture reference to the specific obligations raised by those external sources of authority.

This section should avoid:

- repetition on importance of the specific capability, or content which exists within the Definition or Purpose.

### Policy elements

Capabilities automatically display a list of policy elements aggregated from the requirements connected to related policies. The rules for policy requirements are covered in the Policy content model.

## Policy

### Direct link

Where a policy is hosted on another website in full, put a link to the document with the URL showing.

See Publishing note: Improving accessibility when using URLs as link text

### Policy outline

Policies should have a policy outline which briefly describe the content of the policy.

#### Rules for policy outline (introduction)

- As it is the first part of the page the policy outline does not need its own heading
- It should aim to be around 100 words in length and of no more than 200 words
- It must follow the Style Manual on [Paragraphs \| Style Manual](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/paragraphs)
- It may use [Lists \| Style Manual](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/lists)
- Avoid putting a notice or note at the top of the content. Instead use the policy content type structure. Where a policy comes into effect in future, note this in the Applicability section instead.

### Applicability

A section explaining the circumstances under which the policy applies.

Example 1:  
Applicability

Unless formally excepted, the Benefits Management Policy applies where digital and ICT investment: 

- is brought forward by a non-corporate Commonwealth entity and, where specifically requested by the Minister responsible for the Digital Transformation Agency, a Corporate Commonwealth entity
- involves digital or ICT costs
- is being brought forward for government consideration as a new policy proposal.

Example 2:  
Applicability

The Digital Inclusion Standard is being introduced with a transitional approach.

The Standard is mandatory for non-corporate Commonwealth entities and applies to new public and staff facing services from 01 January 2025 and existing public facing services from 01 July 2026.

#### Rules for policy applicability

- Have at most two introductory sentences.
- Avoid long blocks of content, complex sentences or multiple clauses.
- If listing specific criteria use bullet points.

If a specific policy has lengthy or complex applicability wording:

- note that specific or varying applicability and scope apply
- include a link direct to the specific applicability section in the full text source.

#### Highlight the Policy content state within the AGA

Use the Applicability section to note that a policy position is unendorsed policy content.

Use the following wording placed at the end of the Applicability section and immediately before the policy requirements heading:

This [name] policy position represents the DTA’s opinion of best practice and a [name] policy is currently [being drafted/under consultation]. 

This line of text supports the suffix added to policy position titles, providing greater clarity to readers.

### Access the policy

A single line of text with the following format and structure:

The [hostname or site name] website hosts the [full policy name] (full text).

This line must be included where an AGA policy page summarises an existing policy.

It must be phrased consistently as this ensures users understand where to locate the authoritative published version of any Whole of Government policy.

### Policy requirements list

The Policy Requirements section contains an explanation of the obligations on commonwealth entities to achieve the intent of the policy. It is written as a list with brief, specific, uniquely relevant requirements.

#### Rules for policy requirements

- State the requirement clearly.
- Use key words in the first 2 or 3 words.
- Start with a verb.
- Use bullet lists.
- Be around 25 words maximum in length overall, and never more than 50 words in length.
- Use a heading sentence if any of the requirements in the list is longer than two sentences. The heading should be:
   - a short sentence of about 6 words
   - formatted in bold (using <strong> semantic markup in html)
   - have one or two subsequent sentences which succinctly explain the requirement.

Where a policy requirement is a direct translation of an obligation imposed by an existing instrument (such as a Whole of Government Policy or piece of legislation):

- reference the instrument that imposes the obligation
- provide a direct link to the authoritative source of the full text
- follow the Style manual advice on links, including putting links at the end of sentence.

#### Content style considerations for policy requirements 

- Avoid direct duplication with other policies.  
Policies within the same domain can have similarly worded requirements. Policy Requirements of one Policy don’t need to be repeated in separate tangentially related Policies, particularly from another Domain.
- Avoid use of multi-level lists  
Follow the style manual advice (see: [Lists \| Style Manual](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/lists#avoid_using_a_multilevel_list)) to avoid multi-level lists, except where presenting related elements of a policy requirement grouped together in a child list would make most sense. Never use child lists more than one level lower.
- Reference relevant external policy, standards and guidelines

Policy requirements should include any specific whole of government policies, standards, or guidelines that must be adhered to.

## Standard

### Direct link

Where a standard is hosted on another website in full, put a link to the document with the URL showing.

See Publishing note: Improving accessibility when using URLs as link text

### Introduction

As the first part of the page the standard introduction does not need its own heading.

#### Applicability

The Applicability section sits within the introduction, without a heading. It is always the last part of the introduction. It is distinct in that it contains paragraphs with a consistent structure, such as the example below:

Example:

The [Name of Standard] is being introduced with a transitional approach. It applies to new public and staff facing services from 01 January 2025 and existing public facing services from 01 July 2026.

The Standard is mandatory for non-corporate Commonwealth entities.

### Access the standard

A single line of text with the following format and structure:

The [hostname or site name] website hosts the [full standard name] (full text).

This line must be included where an AGA standard page summarises an existing standard.

It must be phrased consistently as this ensures users understand where to locate the authoritative published version of a standard.

### Standard statements

The standards statements section should be structured as a series of headings which reflect the wording and the order of corresponding policy’s list of requirements.

The section uses either short paragraphs or bullet lists consistently across each of Standard Statements it contains.

#### Rules for Standard statements

They should:

- Begin with “Entities must” or “Entities should”.  
(For background on these terms refer to [RFC 2119](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt))
- Be concise
- Describe what needs to happen to meet the policy requirements
- Use about two or three sentences (or two or three lists) to expand on each policy consideration area and provide further details
- Include non-governmental standards where they provide guidance and best practices.

#### Potential future metadata to record for each Standard statements

- When it is applicable in the IOF process?
- When to apply in the Service design and delivery process (for example “Discovery stage: exploring the problem” stage)

## Design

### Direct link

Where a design is hosted on another website in full, put a link to the resource with the URL showing.

See Publishing note: Improving accessibility when using URLs as link text

### Design description

Design patterns must have a description. It briefly describes the resource (and is used by search engines and displayed in other parts of the AGA website).

The description must clearly and briefly describe the design. It may reference overarching strategies to give context about the long-term or overall goals and objectives a policy helps government achieve.

#### Rules for design description

- A description should be around 150 words in length and of no more than 300 words.
- It must follow the Style Manual on [Paragraphs \| Style Manual](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/paragraphs).
- It may use [Lists \| Style Manual](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/structuring-content/lists).
- A description does not need a heading as it follows the page title directly.

Design patterns have multiple forms, including:

- Approaches
- Patterns
- Solutions
- Platforms
- Procurement approaches
- Procurement panels
- Reusable procurement clauses
- Reusable code and components
- Specifications
- Process descriptions
- Guides
- Blueprints
- Better practice guides
- Decision guides
- Policy development guides
- Templates
- Case studies
- Tools
